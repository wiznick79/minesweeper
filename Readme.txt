- Added question mark system on 2nd right click (->flag->question mark->none)
- Added double-click on open tiles to open its adjacent tiles, if there are equal flagged adjacent tiles.
  eg. if you double-click on a '2' and there are 2 flagged adjacent tiles, it will open the non-flagged adjacent tiles.
  If the flagged tiles are wrong you are going to lose!
