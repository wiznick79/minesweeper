Minesweeper help

This game is a clone of the classic Minesweeper game.
The goal is to reveal all tiles without clicking on any mine.
You can choose between 3 difficulty levels or make your own custom game.
The number of the mines is shown in the top right corner. On the top left corner you can see the elapsed time.
When you left-click on a tile, it will get revealed. 
If it contains a mine, you lose the game. If it contains a number, it's the number of mines that exist in adjacent tiles. If it is empty, its adjacent tiles will also get revealed.
You can flag a tile that you believe is a mine by right clicking it. A flagged tile cannot be opened unless you remove the flag.
When not sure if a tile has a mine or not, you can put a question mark on it with a second right click. A third right click will remove the question mark.
If you double click on a opened tile with number and there are equal flags around it, the unopened adjacent tiles will get revealed.
Be careful with this though! If you have put wrong flags, you are going to lose!
