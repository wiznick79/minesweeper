This game is a clone of the classic Minesweeper game.
Minesweeper is a logic game where mines are hidden in a grid of squares. The goal is to open all safe squares in the quickest time possible.
Minesweeper starts when a player clicks on a square with the left mouse button. The first click is always safe and reveals a number or an opening surrounded by numbers. Each number tells you how many mines touch the square. 
You can mark a mine by putting a flag on it with the right mouse button. If all the mines touching a number are flagged, you can double click on that number to clear the remaining adjacent squares. Be careful with this though! If you have put wrong flags, you are going to lose! If you are unsure, you can put a question mark by right clicking on a flagged square. A third right click clears the question mark.
You win by clearing all the safe squares and lose if you click on a mine. 
A mine counter tells you how many mines are still hidden and a time counter keeps track of your score. 
There are three levels of difficulty: Easy has 10 mines, Normal has 40 mines, and Hard has 99 mines. It is also possible to create custom levels.
